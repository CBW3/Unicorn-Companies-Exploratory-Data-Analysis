# Unicorn-Companies-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
I perform exploratory data analysis procedures on a large dataset related to "unicorn companies".

I did this as part as my Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate program.

In this exercise, I use various packages, functions, and notation to clean, transform, and wrangle data.

In particular, I mostly use the Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, and MatPlotLib packages.

Throughout this exercise, I produce visualizations to help communicate my results clearly to a general audience.
